# Docker Setup and Installation

To use Docker on your system, follow the setup instructions based on your operating system:

## Windows

1. **Docker WSL2/Linux subsystem on Windows:**
   - Set up Docker to work with Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2).
   - Click [here](https://docker.com/setup/windows) for the Docker Desktop installation on Windows.

2. **Docker Desktop:**
   - Install Docker Desktop for Windows by clicking [here](https://docker.com/setup/windows).
   - Make sure to enable Windows Hyper-V settings for Docker to function properly.

Please note that Docker on Windows provides two options: using WSL2/Linux subsystem or installing Docker Desktop directly. Choose the one that suits your needs best.
